# ReaderElf

ReaderElf is a reading assistant app to read aloud text from books, blogs and other sources.

This repository contains the core code for the application and a `Doc/` folder with product requirements, user-facing documentation, templates and contributor guidelines.


Where to find useful docs:

- `Doc/` - product requirements, templates and user-facing documentation

Quick start for contributors

1. Read `Doc/README.md` for an overview of this documentation structure.
2. Open `Doc/user_docs/QUICK_START.md` to see a short user guide.
3. Propose features using `Doc/templates/PRD_TEMPLATE.md` and add roadmap items to `Doc/templates/ROADMAP_TEMPLATE.md`.

If you'd like me to also scaffold an `src/` or `web/` code structure for the app, tell me which platform you'd like (electron, web app, native macOS) and I'll add a starter project.
